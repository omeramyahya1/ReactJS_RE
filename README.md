## Author

Omer A.M. Yahya.

## Overview

The coding started on Jan 29th 2023 and finished on Feb 6th 2023.
This is my first ever website, and Also the first time I use HTML5 to implement a project, ReactJS was used and other dependencies, you can find them in the `package.json` file

## Key features

- This is a prototype for a frontend (UI only) website, that resembles a property management for a Real Estate company.
- There is no authentecation functionality used, the page is non-responsive.

## Tech

This website uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- ReactJS frame work
- npm, package manager

## Installation

This website requires [npm] to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd re-app
npm i pakcage.json
npm start
```
